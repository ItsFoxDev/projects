# 🏷️ MontereyFox
A Firefox theme that looks like Safari on MacOS Monterey

# ⚠️ Notice
Please note that this theme is glitchy, and I am less than skilled at CSS, so I might not be able to fix everything. If you do know how to fix a certain issue in the theme, please let me know in the `Issues` tab, it helps a ton. :)

# 📲 How to install?
1. Download the theme with the big green button: "Code" >> Download.zip
2. Go to your Firefox profile.

	+ Open about:support
	+ Click the button beside `Profile Folder`

3. Drag the `Chrome` folder to your profile directory
4. Drag the `user.js` file to your profile directory
5. Restart Firefox.
